                <h3>Network Security</h3>
                <hr style="color: rgba(250, 235, 215, 0.336);">
                <h3>What Is Network Security?</h3>
                <p>Network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized
                    access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications,
                    users, and applications to work in a secure manner.</p>
                <h3>How does network security work?</h3>
                <p>Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network
                    security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources,
                    but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats.</p>
                <h3>How do I benefit from network security?</h3>
                <p>Digitization has transformed our world. How we live, work, play, and learn have all changed. Every
                    organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its
                    network. Network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. Ultimately it
                    protects your reputation.</p>
