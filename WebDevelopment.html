                <p>A web development major typically focuses on equipping students with the knowledge and skills
                    required to design, build, and maintain websites and web applications. It combines elements of
                    computer science, programming, and design to provide a comprehensive understanding of web
                    technologies and development processes.</p>
                <h3>Here are some key topics that may be covered in a web development major:</h3>
                <ol style="text-align: center; margin-left: 50px;">
                    <li>HTML/CSS: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are fundamental
                        languages used for structuring and styling web content. Students will learn how to create web
                        pages, format text, add images, and apply styles.</li>

                    <li>Programming Languages: Common programming languages used in web development include JavaScript,
                        Python, PHP, and Ruby. Students may learn programming concepts, syntax, and how to use these
                        languages to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>

                    <li>Front-End Development: This involves the creation of the user interface and user experience
                        (UI/UX) components of a website. Students will learn about front-end frameworks and libraries
                        like React, Angular, or Vue.js, and gain skills in building responsive and accessible web
                        interfaces.</li>

                    <li>Back-End Development: Back-end development focuses on server-side programming and database
                        management. Students may learn about server-side languages like Node.js, PHP, or Python, as well
                        as databases such as MySQL or MongoDB. They will understand how to handle user input, process
                        data, and interact with servers.</li>

                    <li>Web Design Principles: Students will learn about design principles, including color theory,
                        typography, layout, and usability. They will understand how to create visually appealing and
                        user-friendly websites.</li>

                    <li>Web Security: Web developers need to understand how to protect websites from security threats.
                        This may include topics such as secure coding practices, authentication, data encryption, and
                        common vulnerabilities.</li>

                    <li>Web Development Tools: Students will become familiar with various web development tools and
                        technologies, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), text editors, version control
                        systems (e.g., Git), and deployment platforms.</li>

                    <li>Mobile-First and Responsive Design: With the increasing use of mobile devices, students may
                        learn how to develop websites that are optimized for mobile viewing and responsive across
                        different screen sizes.</li>

                    <li>Web Performance Optimization: Techniques for optimizing web performance, including minimizing
                        file sizes, caching, and reducing load times, are important aspects of web development.</li>

                    <li>Project Management: Students may gain an understanding of project management methodologies,
                        including agile development, and learn how to work collaboratively in teams and manage web
                        development projects effectively.</li>
                </ol>
